The main objective of the project is to create an online book store that allows users to search and purchase a book online based on title, author, name & ISBN. 
The customer can search for books and add them to shopping cart and proceed to checkout. The customer can use a credit card for purchasing the books. 
A new user can create his account through a registration page by entering all the required details. The registered user can login using his login credentials. 
The registered user can edit his personal information, add or delete a credit card and view order history. If a customer does not register, then they can purchase the book as guest user.
 The customer can place the order of the books selected. Once the order is placed he can edit the shipping information and view the status of the order. 
The Administrator has the privileges to add, delete and update book information as well as update the customer information.
